# Fake-News

Gradient tree boosting and logistic regression proved to be useful methods for detecting fake news. Adding part-of-speech tags bunched as 3-grams provided only marginal improvement if any. Using TF-IDF vectorization (scaling word counts in individual documents by counts across all documents) gave marked improvement when using k-nn methods and slight improvement with most other methods.
